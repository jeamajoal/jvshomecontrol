# Panel Profiles

Panel profiles let you customise the look and feel of each dashboard display independently. A living room tablet can have a warm amber theme while the bedroom uses cool blue.

## What Is a Panel Profile?

A panel profile stores a **visual identity** for a single display:

- Accent colour (22+ built-in choices)
- Icon colour and opacity
- Primary / secondary / tertiary text colours
- Glow effect colour
- Background image and opacity

Layout settings (card scale, room columns, text sizes, blur) are shared globally across all profiles.

## How to Use Panel Profiles

### 1. Open the Settings page

Click the gear icon in the navigation menu.

### 2. Switch themes

In the **Panel Profiles** section, click any preset theme to preview it instantly. The dashboard updates in real time.

### 3. Create a custom profile

1. Click **New Profile**
2. Give it a name (e.g., "Living Room Tablet")
3. Optionally seed it from an existing preset
4. Customise the accent colour, icon colour, glow, and text colours

### 4. Assign profiles to displays

Each browser/tablet remembers which profile it selected. Simply open the dashboard on a device, choose a profile, and it sticks.

## Per-Display Settings

Profiles also control per-display device visibility:

| Setting | What It Controls |
|---------|------------------|
| **Visible Rooms** | Which rooms appear on the Home page |
| **Home Device IDs** | Which devices show metrics on the Home page |
| **Controls Device IDs** | Which devices appear on the Controls page |
| **Accent Colour** | Primary colour for the entire theme |

This lets you create a "Kitchen" profile that only shows kitchen devices, or a "Bedroom" profile with a minimal set.

## Tips

- **Preview before committing** — clicking a preset applies it live. Switch away to revert.
- **Preset themes can't be edited** — create a custom profile to modify colours.
- **Use allowlists** — pair profiles with device visibility to create purpose-built panels.
- **Name profiles by location** — "Master Bedroom", "Kitchen Counter", "Garage" makes it clear which device gets which.
